            <div class="more-info-container" id="frontend">
               As a company, our vision is to provide solutions that will focus on the entity and its individual needs. It is also an affordable solution to prevent the hard decisions business owners make daily whether they want to survive or comply with applicable Occupational health and safety and relevant legislation frameworks. 

Hybrid SHEQ Solutions have a firm belief that NO operational organisation should be left with the choice to choose between survival and or compliance. We strive to ensure that both options are encapsulated in our unique solutions.

         <div class="more-info-container" id="ic-fast-cash-app">
            In order for the company to move towards achieving our vision, we first had to build a bit of relationships.  Through our relationship building, we managed to partner with a SHEQ software company that shares a similar vision as Hybrid SHEQ Solutions. Through that partnership we are able to provide tailored made solutions at a fraction of the price you normally would pay for similar solutions.

         <div class="more-info-container" id="cms-panic">
            It was a tough few years to get the name out in the market, however we have set out to help at least 60 clients with their compliance and that target was achieved by 2021. For the next 3 years our goal is to double that and extend our service offerings to those who need it.
